# Learn Assembly FU

> An introduction into Assembly programming with nasm designed as supplement for the computer sciense bachelor at Freie UniversitÃ¤t Berlin.

This project is designed to support your learning journey by offering supplements to the course materials, providing more detailed explanations on certain topics, and offering insights into exemplary code and project ideas for further study. Please note that this project is not intended to replace the primary learning materials and cannot convey all critical information on its own. However, you do not need to be taking the computer architecture course to learn Assembly from this project.

## Work in progress

This project is still under construction. I will try to continue developing this project in a way that the finished content can be used in a coherent way. Any [contributions](#contributing) that speed up the process or improve the project are always welcome.

## Features

### [Lecture00](https://github.com/PuEnjoy/Learn-Assembly-FU/blob/main/lecture00.md) - Introduction

> Theoretical introduction to some very basic instructions and general knowladge.

Learn about registers and basic instructions on registers. Compare registers and use conditional jumps to controll the program flow.

### [Lecture01](https://github.com/PuEnjoy/Learn-Assembly-FU/blob/main/lecture01.md) - Syscalls

> Practical approach to programming with NASM and system calls

Learn how to create your first standalone program using system calls to print to the console and properly exit the program. Use make to assemble your code and create first `Hello, World!`. Use NASM to assemble your code without make.

#### [Syscall table](https://github.com/PuEnjoy/Learn-Assembly-FU/blob/main/syscalltable_linuxkernel_64bit.md) - Linuxkernel 64 Bit

> Extensive syscall table for 64 Bit Linux Kernel systems.

### $ [Lecture02](workInProgrss) - Debugging ~ TODO

> Debugging Assembly programs using gdb.

### $ [Lecture03](workInProgrss) - Gauss ~ TODO

> Calculate and print Gaussian sum without C-wrapper.

## Roadmap

- lecture01 using nasm to assemble your code

- protection rings *(introduction for students without knowledge about operating systems)*

- Gauss without wrapper *(Recreate the first exercise sheet without using a C wrapper)*

- Debugging with gdb

- Example Project and project ideas for self study
